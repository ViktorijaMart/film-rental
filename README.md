# Film Rental Project

This is a project we did at CodeAcademy in order to practice writing and sending queries to a database.

This project has these pages:

- Home Page: displays the list of actors, has pagination, and search input to search actors by name or surname. Clicking on the actor's name sends the user to the actor's page.
- Actor page: displays the info about the actor including the filmography. The user can find out more about the movie by clicking on the 'Read More' button.
- Film page: displays the info about the movie, has a button to rent the movie (not working), and the list of actors present in this movie. By clicking on those the user is sent to the actor's page.

## Details

It was interesting to move from writing individual queries to using them in this project. 

I also had so much fun displaying the fetched data and writing the CSS to make it look presentable.

## Built with

- PHP
- Smarty
- We used data from a MySQL database we created previously.
